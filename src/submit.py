Requirement: Logged in.

Description: Read the compilers a TIOJ problem accepts off its submission form. TIOJ keeps a
             compiler's id in a database row, so it differs between instances and cannot be
             hardcoded, while the name is unique and stable. The name is the part of the
             description TIOJ shows before the first '/', for example the description
             "c++17/gnu c++ compiler 11.2.0 | options: -O2 -std=c++17" belongs to "c++17".

             Reading the form also means the compilers a problem bans are left out, since TIOJ
             does not offer them there in the first place.

Return value: A list of (name, description, id), in the order TIOJ lists them.

Requirement: None.

Description: Work out which of the compilers of a problem to submit with. A name given on the
             command line wins, looked up as it is written and then through
             tioj_instance.compiler_alias, and the file's extension decides when there is none.
             Nothing is guessed beyond that: submitting with the wrong compiler only shows up
             as a compilation error much later, so an unknown name is an error rather than a
             fallback to some default.

Description: Read the verdict of a submission off its own page. While TIOJ is still judging it
             shows a waiting icon there, which is how it marks the verdicts that are not final
             ("queued", "received" and "Validating"), so the icon being gone is what tells a
             finished submission from one that merely reads as waiting.

Requirement: Logged in.

Description: Read the largest time a submission spent on one testcase off its page. This is not
             the time TIOJ shows next to the verdict, which is the times of every testcase
             added up, while the one worth comparing against the time limit is the largest of
             them.

             The times are padded with hidden digits to keep the decimal points of a column in
             line, so only the text of the cell itself is a number, not the text of what it
             contains.

Return value: The largest time in milliseconds, or None when the page carries no testcase
              times, which is how a submission that never ran looks.
